i've known it from the very start
we're a shot in the darkest dark
oh no, oh no
i'm unarmed
the waiting is a sadness
fading into madness
oh no, oh no
it won't stop

i'm standing on a tightrope, alone
i hold my breath a little bit longer
halfway out the door, but it won't close
i'm holding out hope for you to say, don't go
i would stay forever if you say, don't go

why'd you have to lead me on?
why'd you have to twist the knife?
walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
why'd you whisper in the dark
just to leave me in the night?
now your silence has me screaming, screaming
say, don't go say, don't go
i would stay forever if you say, don't go say, don't go
say, say, say, say

now i'm pacing on shaky ground
strike a match, then you blow it out
oh no, oh no
it's not fair
'cause you kiss me and it stops time
and i'm yours, but you're not mine
oh no, oh no
you're not there

i'm standing on the sidewalk, alone
i wait for you to drive by
i was trying to see the cards that you won't show
i'm about to fold unless you say, don't go say, don't go
i would stay forever if you say, don't go say, don't go
ohah

why'd you have to lead me on?
why'd you have to twist the knife?
walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
why'd you whisper in the dark
just to leave me in the night?
now your silence has me screaming, screaming
say, don't go say, don't go
i would stay forever if you say, don't go say, don't go
say, say, say, say

why'd you have to make me want you? why'd you have to make me want you?
why'd you have to give me nothing back? why'd you have to
why'd you have to make me love you? why'd you have to make me love you?
i said, i love you, you say nothing back i said, i love you

why'd you have to lead me on?
why'd you have to twist the knife?
walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
why'd you whisper in the dark
just to leave me in the night?
now your silence has me screaming, screaming
say, don't go say, don't go
i would stay forever if you say, don't go say, don't go
say, say, say, say

but you won't
but you won't
but you won't
i would stay forever if you say, don't go
but you won't
but you won't
but you won't
