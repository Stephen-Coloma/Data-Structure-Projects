# PRELIM PROJECTS
## 1. Comparative Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

This project aims to perform a comparative analysis of three sorting algorithms. Dataset of various sizes
and scenarios were utilized to compare the performance of the three sorting algorithms. Further, a detailed comparison paper were  
the requirement for this project.


### Sorting Algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort Algorithm**
- **Insertion Sort Algorithm**
- **Selection Sort Algorithm**

For a report of our findings, methodology, and results, refer to our detailed [MixAndMatchPrelimGroupProjectOnAlgorithmAnalysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gKtJAHLXlthI0EKCrLfHiYVjrzdE2HUzpNh-_AHTRSQ/edit).

Data files for various sizes and scenarios can be found in the `Prelims.Project1.dataset` directory.

## 2. LinkedList Implementation and Application

In this project, we were tasked to illustrate a real life application of the linked list data structure in representing data.
The project imitates the Google Classroom and a "list of list of list" were utilized to represent the courses, course terms and term activities.
Furthermore, CRUD (Creat, Read, Update, and Delete) operations were implemented in the application as it is required for this project.

# MIDTERM PROJECTS
## 1. Infix to Postfix and Postfix Evaluation
The goal of this project is to create a program that can efficiently convert an infix mathematical expression into its equivalent postfix form. In addition to this conversion, the project also aims to evaluate the postfix expression and determine its numerical value. The underlying logic of the program relies on the use of a stack data structure to manage the order of operations and efficiently process the expressions.

### Allowed Operations:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exponentiation (^)
6. Equal Symbol (=)

## 2. Huffman Coding
In this project, a program were developed to emulate huffman coding. The user is able to enter a set of characters, strings of paragraphs and the program automatically creates the huffman code for each character in the given text.
Furthermore, the program calculates the storage savings in using the huffman code compared to ASCII encodings. 
Tree data structure were utilized in this project
### Other functionalities include: 

- Encrypting entered text to huffman code
- Decrypting huffman code to equivalent text
- Count frequency of character occurrences

# FINAL PROJECTS
## 1. Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Dijkstra's Shortest Path 
This project aims to represent the BFS, DFS and Dijkstra's Algorithm in a menu based program. The program is designed to be able to perform both in directed and undirected type of graphs. The graph is loaded in a file that contains information of the graph.
Graph, Stack and Queue data structures were utilised in this project.
